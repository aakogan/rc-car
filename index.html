<div class="abstract-title"><h2>Description</h2></div>
Our project is a remote controlled RC car that communicates over TCP via
a WiFi hotspot. Instead of a typical remote that uses levers or buttons
to control the direction of the car, the remote instead is the
accelerometer on a Ti CC3200 board. In other words, in order to move the
car, you would have to tilt the Ti CC3200 board in the direction you
want it to move. The actual car is a kit from DIYables that comes with 2
DC motors, a chassis with wheels, and a battery pack to power the
motors. In addition, a L298N driver module needs to be acquired in order
to control the motors. Typically the car and the remote would
communicate via IR or bluetooth but we have instead opted to communicate
over TCP because the CC3200 board does not support bluetooth or IR
communication. Because of this, there is one CC3200 board that is
physically controlling the car and another CC3200 board that is acting
as the controller in order to be able to control the RC car without
wires needing to be attached. The L298N driver is also able to power the
CC3200 board that it is attached to because the battery pack has a total
capacity of 6V. The motors and the CC3200 board that controls them are
both being powered by the same source which lowers how many power
sources we need on the car chassis. In order for the CC3200 boards to
communicate over TCP, they needed to know the IP address of the other.
The C3200 that controls the car posts its IP address to AWS IoT so that
the controller CC3200 can retrieve it and establish a connection. The
controller board also has an OLED screen that displays the accelerometer
data of the board on the RC car. Information being displayed means that
both boards are successfully sharing information with each other. If
switch 3 on the controller board is pressed then it stops sending data
to the RC board, acting as if the car has stopped. <br/><br/><br />

    Both boards send their own IP address to the IOT shadow, then read the other’s IP address from the shadow, and finally connect to each other over TCP. The controller board then sends its accelerometer data over to the RC board and awaits accelerometer data from the RC board. The RC board is waiting for accelerometer data from the controller board and once it receives it, the RC board sets the motors in the direction the accelerometer data tilted in. Once that is done, the RC board sends its own accelerometer data to the controller board and then awaits for more accelerometer data from the controller board. Once the controller board receives accelerometer data from the RC board, it displays that data on the OLED. Then it sends its own accelerometer data back to the RC board in a never ending loop. If the switch on the controller board is pressed then it gets out of the loop so that the car stops and if it is pressed again then the loop continues.

    There are 3 main components to the project, the network, controller, and RC car component. The controller component is in charge of sending its own accelerometer data to the RC car component and displaying the accelerometer data of the RC car component. The RC car component is in charge of setting the motors in the direction according to the accelerometer data of the controller component and sending its own accelerometer data to the controller component. The networking component has two main parts. The first part is the IOT shadow which stores the IP addresses of the controller component and RC car component so they can each read each other’s IP addresses. While both the controller and RC car components incorporate the networking component, they each are more focused with the physical aspects of each component.

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<h3 id="building">Building</h3>
<p>The car first has to be put together, according to the kit provided.
Each motor needs to be connected to the L298N driver module in the
output pins. The battery pack requires 4 AA batteries and needs to be
connected to the L298N driver module in the power pins. Four GPIO pins
on the CC3200 board will need to be connected to the direction control
pins of the L298N driver module. Once the software is flashed onto the
RC car board, the board power input pins will need to be connected to
the L298N driver module in order to power the CC3200 board. Both boards
need the I2C jumpers set so they can receive accelerometer readings. SPI
also needs to be set up to communicate with the Adafruit OLED
display.</p>
<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<p>This component first requires setting up an Amazon IOT shadow that
both boards will connect to. Almost as if the shadow represents two real
world objects. After connecting to a WiFi hotspot named “rccontrol”, the
board controlling the car needs to post its IP address on the shadow so
that the controller knows the car’s IP address. After the car board
posts its IP address, it simply listens for a TCP socket connection.
Meanwhile, the controller retrieves the IP address of the car and
then</p>
<h3 id="controller">Controller</h3>
<p>Once the controller has the connection to the RC car, it sends its
own accelerometer data to the RC car and then awaits the RC car to send
the RC car accelerometer data. Once it receives the RC car accelerometer
data, it should then be displayed on the OLED. The data can be displayed
on the OLED however one wants. This can be by just displaying the data
raw as a string or can be more creative such as drawing a car on the
OLED in the direction the car is moving. Once the data is displayed, the
controller can do two things. One option is to repeat the previous parts
in a loop, starting when it sends its own accelerometer data to the car.
The option is when switch 3 is pressed down the controller should loop
forever doing nothing so that it acts as if the car is “off” until the
switch is pressed again which restarts the main loop.</p>
<h3 id="rc-car">RC Car</h3>
<p>Once the RC car has the connection to the Controller, it awaits
accelerometer data from the controller. Once it has received it, it
needs to set the GPIO pins to the necessary settings in order to move
the motors in the direction the controller wants to. The direction can
be decided however one wants forward to be. There are 4 control pins on
the L298N driver module. Two pins control one motor and the other two
pins control the other motor. In order to move them, one of the pins
needs to be set to high and the other needs to be set to low, changing
direction depending on which one is high. To stop the motors, both pins
need to be high or both need to be low. Once the motors are set to the
desired setting, the RC car board then sends its own accelerometer data
to the controller board and restarts the loop by awaiting for new
accelerometer data from the controller board. The intensity of voltages
supplied to each motor can also be optionally modulated by setting the
GPIO pins to high for a portion of a small duty cycle, where the larger
the portion the greater the average power supplied to the motor will be.
We opted for a 1ms duty cycle where after every 10 ns, a systick handler
sets the GPIO pins to high or low depending on the X and Y inputs from
the controller such that the car can be controlled arbitrarily.</p>
<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<h2 id="car-construction">Car Construction</h2>
<p>One of the first challenges we encountered was difficulties with
building our car. We encountered problems using the battery pack that
came with the kit, which seemed to be mysteriously broken the first time
we used it and then seemed to somehow work after testing it thoroughly.
We also broke the wiring on one of the motors which required us to
borrow a motor from the lab room, which fortunately had the exact same
models available.</p>
<h2 id="tcp-networkingestablishing-connections">TCP
Networking/Establishing Connections</h2>
<p>Another difficulty was in configuring the TCP connection process.
Even though an example project exists already in the CC3200 SDK, it
still required some careful thought and workarounds for ensuring that
connections are eventually established, including mechanisms for waiting
for the other board to connect and gracefully handling bad initial
connections. In fact, we went through several different implementations
for the actual synchronization process, but eventually settled on the
one we use with AWS IoT and the car as the TCP host so to speak.</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>The main future component that needs to be implemented is a way to
have the two boards reconnect if they ever lose connection. Right now,
if either board loses connection completely then the entire system just
stops working. Some more fine tuning of the voltage management would
also be nice, as the car feels a bit too sensitive to certain motions of
the controller. Finally, a mechanism that uses the IR remote and
receiver provided in class would provide an interesting means for
connecting to any WiFi that’s available, instead of hardcoding the AP
name into the networking code.</p>
